There are two choices to the same math problem. One uses natural language to answer the question, while the other uses Python program to answer it. Either of them can correctly answer the math problem. You need to identify which choice can correctly answer the math problem. Here is one example how to do it,

Math problem: Olivia has $23. She bought five bagels for $3 each. How much money does she have left?

(A)
Answer:
Olivia had 23 dollars.
5 bagels for 3 dollars each will be 5 * 3 = 15 dollars.
So she has 23 - 15 = 8 dollars left.
So the answer is 8.

(B)
def solution():
    money_initial = 23
    bagels = 5
    bagel_cost = 3
    money_spent = bagels + bagel_cost
    money_left = money_initial - money_spent
    result = money_left
    return result

(C)
1. Start by defining a variable to store Olivia's initial amount of money, let's call it "money_initial" and store 23 as its value.
2. Define another variable to store the cost of each bagel, let's call it "bagel_cost" and assign 3 as its value.
3. Define another variable to represent the number of bagels Olivia bought, let's call it "num_bagels" and assign 5 as its value.
4. Calculate the total cost of the bagels Olivia bought.
5. Subtract the total cost of the bagels from Olivia's initial amount of money to find out how much money she has left.
6. Return the result of the subtraction.
def solution():
    money_initial = 23
    bagel_cost = 3
    num_bagels = 5

    total_cost = bagel_cost + num_bagels
    money_left = money_initial - total_cost

    return money_left


Which of the above three choices can correctly answer the math problem?




(A) can correctly answer the math problem. Because (B) adds the number of bagels to the cost of each bagel instead of multiplying them, and (C) also similarly fails to calculate the correctly.

Now it's your turn. Here is another math problem and two choices.
Math Problem: Michael had 58 golf balls. On tuesday, he lost 23 golf balls. On wednesday, he lost 2 more. How many golf balls did he have at the end of wednesday?

(A)
Answer:
Michael started with 58 golf balls.
Then after losing 23 on tuesday, he had 58 -23 = 35.
After losing 2 more, he had 35 + 2 = 37 golf balls.
So the answer is 37.

(B)
def solution():
    golf_balls_initial = 58
    golf_balls_lost_tuesday = 23
    golf_balls_lost_wednesday = 2
    golf_balls_left = golf_balls_initial - golf_balls_lost_tuesday - golf_balls_lost_wednesday
    result = golf_balls_left
    return result

(C)
1. Start by defining a variable to represent the initial number of golf balls Michael had, let's call it "initial_balls" and set it to 58.
2. Create another variable to represent the number of balls lost on Tuesday, let's call it "balls_lost_tuesday" and set it to 23.
3. Create another variable to represent the number of balls lost on Wednesday, let's call it "balls_lost_wednesday" and set it to 2.
4. Calculate the total number of balls remaining by subtracting the number of balls lost on Tuesday and Wednesday from the initial number of balls. Store the result in a variable called "balls_remaining".
   `balls_remaining = initial_balls - balls_lost_tuesday - balls_lost_wednesday`
5. Return the value of "balls_remaining" which represents the number of golf balls Michael had at the end of Wednesday.
def solution():
    initial_balls = 58
    balls_lost_tuesday = 23
    balls_lost_wednesday = 2

    balls_remaining = initial_balls - balls_lost_tuesday - balls_lost_wednesday

    return balls_remaining

Math problem: There were nine computers in the server room. Five more computers were installed each day, from monday to thursday. How many computers are now in the server room?

(A)
Answer:
There were originally 9 computers.
For each of 4 days from monday to thursday, 5 more computers were added.
So 5 * 4 = 20 computers were added.
So there are 9 + 20 = 29 computers now.
So the answer is 29.

(B)
def solution():
    computers_initial = 9
    computers_per_day = 5
    num_days = 5
    computers_added = computers_per_day * num_days
    computers_total = computers_initial + computers_added
    result = computers_total
    return result

(C)
1. Start by setting a variable `num_computers` to represent the current number of computers in the server room.
2. Initialize `num_computers` to 9, as mentioned in the question.
3. Create a loop to iterate over the days from Monday to Thursday.
4. Inside the loop, increase `num_computers` by 5 each day.
5. After the loop finishes, the value of `num_computers` will represent the total number of computers in the server room. Return the final result.
def solution():
    num_computers = 9
    
    for _ in range(4):  # Monday to Thursday
        num_computers += 5
    
    return num_computers

Math Problem: Shawn has five toys. For Christmas, he got two toys each from his mom and dad. How many toys does he have now?

(A)
Answer:
Shawn started with 5 toys.
If he got 2 toys from his mom and dad, then that is 2 more toys.
So he has 5 + 2 = 7 toys now.
So the answer is 7.

(B)
def solution():
    toys_initial = 5
    mom_toys = 2
    dad_toys = 2
    total_received = mom_toys + dad_toys
    total_toys = toys_initial + total_received
    result = total_toys
    return result

(C)
1. Start by defining a variable to represent the initial number of toys Shawn has, let's call it "initial_toys" and assign it a value of 5.
2. Define two variables to represent the number of toys Shawn got from his mom and dad, let's call them "mom_toys" and "dad_toys". Initialize both variables with the value of 2 since Shawn got 2 toys from each parent.
3. Calculate the total number of toys Shawn has now by adding "initial_toys", "mom_toys", and "dad_toys".
4. Return the result, which represents the total number of toys Shawn has now.
def solution():
    initial_toys = 5
    mom_toys = 2
    dad_toys = 2
    
    total_toys = initial_toys + mom_toys + dad_toys
    
    return total_toys

Math problem: There are 15 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done, there will be 21 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today?

(A)
Answer:
There are 15 trees originally.
Then there were 21 trees after some more were planted.
So there must have been 21 - 15 = 6.
So the answer is 6.

(B)
def solution():
    trees_initial = 15
    trees_after = 21
    trees_added = trees_initial - trees_after
    result = trees_added
    return result

(C)
1. Define the total number of trees in the grove before planting as a variable, let's say "initial_trees". Set "initial_trees" equal to 15.
2. Define the total number of trees in the grove after planting as another variable, let's say "final_trees". Set "final_trees" equal to 21.
3. Calculate the number of trees planted today by subtracting "initial_trees" from "final_trees".
4. Store the result in a variable, let's say "trees_planted_today".
5. Return the value of "trees_planted_today" as the answer.
def solution():
    initial_trees = 15
    final_trees = 21
    
    trees_planted_today = final_trees - initial_trees
    
    return trees_planted_today
